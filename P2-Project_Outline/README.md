### Overview
This project allows graphic artists, as well as others, to upload low resolution images using drag-and-drop capabilities to our website to be upscaled into high resolution images.  These higher resolution images can be used in marketing ads, 2D video game sprites, or for non-commercial purposes, such as attaining a better quality image from a low resolution photo of friends or family.

The site will allow users to create an account that will allow them to securely login and access the images they've uploaded, as well as their upscaled copies.  Users can then organize their images by sorting them into project categories or folders, deleting obsolete files, and searching their images by name or date.  User images will be securely stored in a database for only authenticated users to access.  Additionally, users will receive an email or SMS notification once their uploaded images have been upscaled, which will contain a link to the image within their secure user account on our website.


### Features
-- Secure user account creation and login authentication
-- Ability for users to upscale low resolution images into high resolution images
-- User's images saved to a database for storage, sorting, and easy access
-- Ability for users to view previously upscaled images as a list of items on their login landing page (user homepage)
-- Ability for users to search project history (in not listed on their homepage)
-- Ability for users to delete completed projects
-- Ability for users to group images into separate projects (categories or folders)
-- User notifications (email or SMS) when image upscaling is complete.  Message should contain hyperlink to image in user's account project history.


### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
Angular (or possibly React)
MySQL (or possibly AWS S3)
Thymeleaf templates
HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap


### What I'll Have to Learn
-- Webpage interface to accomodate users dragging and dropping images to be upscaled
-- API interface to image upscaling application/service
-- API interface to notify users via email or SMS (with link to image) once upscaling is complete
